## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Working with API's/json data is actually really fun! I always thought that those hundreds or event thousands of lines with objects and theur respective properties
looked scary, but once you start working with them is not that bad actually.

### Continued development

I plan on working with API's more and more, and get more comfortable with them since they are so fun and useful!
